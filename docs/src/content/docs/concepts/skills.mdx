Skills are reusable instruction packages that teach agents how to perform specific tasks. They follow the **YAML frontmatter + Markdown body** pattern.

## Using with AgentSession

```typescript
import { createAgentSession } from '@philschmid/agent';

const session = createAgentSession({
  model: 'gemini-3-flash-preview',
  tools: ['read', 'write', 'skills'],  // Enable skills tool
});

session.send('Use the code-review skill to analyze src/index.ts');
```

## Discovery Sources

Skills are loaded from multiple sources with a defined precedence. When two skills share the same name, the **first match wins**:

1. **Project** (`.agent/skills/`) — highest priority
2. **Global** (`~/.agent/skills/`) — shared across projects
3. **Built-in** (shipped with `@philschmid/agent`) — lowest priority

```
# Project skills (highest priority)
.agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Global skills (shared across projects)
~/.agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Built-in skills (shipped with the package)
# e.g. skill-creator
```

### Configuration

Override the paths with environment variables:

```bash
# Override project artifacts path (default: .agent)
export AGENT_ARTIFACTS_PATH=".agent"

# Override global artifacts path (default: ~/.agent)
export AGENT_GLOBAL_ARTIFACTS_PATH="/custom/global/path"
```

## SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and best practices
---

You are an expert code reviewer. When reviewing code:

## Review Checklist
1. Check for security vulnerabilities
2. Verify error handling
3. Review naming conventions
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Unique identifier (used for loading) |
| `description` | string | Brief summary (used for skill selection) |

## Loading Skills

```typescript
import { loadSkills, type ArtifactLayer } from '@philschmid/agent';

// Load from all default sources (project + global + built-in)
const skills = loadSkills();

// Load from specific layers
const skills = loadSkills([
  { path: '.agent', source: 'project' },
  { path: '/custom/path', source: 'global' },
]);
```

### Skill Type

```typescript
type Skill = {
  name: string;        // From frontmatter
  description: string; // From frontmatter
  content: string;     // Markdown body
  path: string;        // Directory path
  source: 'project' | 'global' | 'builtin';
};
```

## Disabling Skills

Disable specific skills by name:

```bash
# Via environment variable (comma-separated)
export AGENT_DISABLED_SKILLS="skill-creator,other-skill"
```

Or in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "disabledSkills": ["skill-creator"]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep frontmatter minimal**: Only `name` and `description`
2. **Use clear, specific descriptions**: Helps with skill selection
3. **Structure the body**: Use headings, lists, and code blocks
4. **Bundle resources**: Include scripts or templates in the skill directory
5. **Override built-ins**: Create a project skill with the same name to customize
